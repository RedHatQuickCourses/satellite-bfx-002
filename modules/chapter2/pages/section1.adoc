*ISSUE 1* Unable to enable the required repos for upgrade since the satellite is registered to some other satellite/capsule server. +
*FIX* +
Remove the existing katello-ca-consumer +
`# rpm -qa | grep katello-ca-consumer | xargs rpm -e` +
Unregister the satellite +
`# subscription-manager clean` +
Rename or move the rhsm.conf +
`# mv /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf /var/tmp` +
Create a fresh rhsm.conf which points to the CDN +
`# cp /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf.kat-backup /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` +
Register it to the Red Hat Portal using your own credentials +
`# subscription-manager register` +
Also make sure manage_repos has 1 instead of 0 in /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf
